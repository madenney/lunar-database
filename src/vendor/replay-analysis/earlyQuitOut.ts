/*
 * Early quit-outs: the kills the combo parser MISSES. A player is comboed to a
 * lethal percent and, rather than let the stock be taken, holds L+R+A+Start to
 * quit ("No Contest"). The stock never decrements, so the combo never sets
 * `didKill` and the play vanishes from a normal kill search.
 *
 * Found by cross-referencing the combos against the game-end record:
 *   - the game ended by No Contest (a quit), and
 *   - the player who quit (`lrasInitiatorIndex`) is the one being comboed, and
 *   - that combo ended right before the quit (it's the one they bailed on), and
 *   - the victim was at or above `killPercent` when they quit (would-be lethal).
 * At most one per game: the single combo the quit interrupted.
